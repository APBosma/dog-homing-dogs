Project for software engineering.

Come up with a title (Working Title)

**Overview**

FosterConnect is an app designed to help communities better care for stray and at-risk dogs and cats. Inspired by real experiences with overcrowded shelters and limited resources, the app creates a direct connection between people who find stray dogs, those who can foster them, and potential adopters. It relies on the generosity of others and it not an application used to proffit from people. although we may potentially run ads to pay for upkeep. 
**
Core Features**

  Foster Network
  
  Users can sign up as foster homes.
  
  Anyone who finds a stray dog can quickly connect with available fosters in their area.
  
  Rehoming Marketplace
  
  A platform for rehoming dogs in need of adoption.
  
  Helps prevent abandonment by allowing owners to post their dogs for adoption.
  
  Makes it easy for potential adopters to browse available dogs.
  
  Shelter Availability (Planned Feature)
  
  Shows real-time availability of local animal shelters.
  
  Helps users know if bringing a stray to a shelter is an option.

**Purpose**

  Too often, stray and surrendered dogs are left without safe options because local shelters are overcrowded. This app provides a community-driven solution by:
  
  Connecting fosters with people who find strays.
  
  Providing a safe and reliable way to rehome dogs.
  
  Offering better visibility into shelter space when available.

**Status
**
  This project is in the early planning stages. We are currently exploring what features are feasible to implement and how best to design the user experience.

**Next Steps**

  Finalize core features based on feedback and project requirements.
  
  Determine scope (web app, mobile app, or prototype).
  
  Begin designing user data flow and consider coding languages
